Clearer content permissions inheritance from parent folders. Easier field dragging into SQL editor. Dynamic stack ordering for stacked charts (second most requested feature). Deep research getting ready for everyone (Blobby multi-stage analysis plans). Topic-scoped fields wired to UI. Better search for massive schemas."

Dashboard localization (more languages, embedded use cases). Dashboard construction overhaul QOL - managing and deleting tiles. Map dashboard filters to calculations. Dashboard fully served out of cubing layer (instant slice and dice). Handling AI summaries when feature is disabled. Custom permissions getting close - handling duplication and resolution between permission groupings. eCharts pie chart testing (replacing Vega for pies). Embed tuning: disable right-click actions, URL-encoded markdown, plus one more."

Level of detail calculations: escape or force grouping independent of the rest of the query (dynamic percent of totals, comparison to unfiltered data). Dashboard tile sizing improvements. Force expose long filter lists beyond default single line. Aggregate directly from visualization when data isn't at right grain."
